Transform the data to facilitate analysis, converting hair growth measurements from inches to millimeters.

## Statistical Analysis

* Boxplot Analysis - visualize hair growth distribution across treatments.
* Two-Sample T-Test - compare Luxuriant and Placebo treatments.
* Linear Model Analysis - compare Luxuriant with other treatments (excluding Placebo).
* Scatter Plot Analysis - examine the relationship between age and hair growth for each treatment.
